* Background

# In this tutorial I'll show you how to install and use the Go Programming Language.

* What is Go?

Go is a new, general-purpose programming language.

- Compiled
- Statically typed
- Concurrent
- Simple
- Productive

"Go is a wise, clean, insightful, fresh thinking approach to the greatest-hits subset of the well understood."
- Michael T. Jones

* Getting started

* Install Go

.link http://golang.org/doc/install

- Install from binary distributions or build from source
- 32- and 64-bit x86 and ARM processors
- Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and FreeBSD
- Other platforms may be supported by `gccgo`

# Go is available in binary form for Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and FreeBSD running under 32 and 64-bit x86 processor architectures. To install Go on these systems, download the appropriate file from golang.org and either open the package installer (Windows or OS X) or extract the archive to /usr/local/go (Linux and FreeBSD).  

# If you use a different operating system or processor architecture, you may still be able to use Go by building it from source or using gccgo (an alternate Go compiler based on the GNU C Compiler). See the installation instructions on golang.org for how to do this.

* Test your Go installation

# Let's build and run a simple Go program to check that we have a valid Go install. Create a file named hello.go somewhere convenient and populate it with this Go source code:

Put this code into `hello.go`:

.play _code/hello-00.go

# Now, from a command prompt, run `go run hello.go`. This will build your program, storing the executable binary in a temporary location, and run it. You should see the greeting printed to the console.

Run the program:

  $ go run hello.go
  Hello RSE Conference 2016


* The go tool

The `go` tool is the standard tool for building, testing, and installing Go programs.

Compile and run `hello.go`:

  $ go run hello.go

Run `zip` tests:

  $ go test archive/zip
  ok  	archive/zip	19.557s

Build and format the files in the current directory:

  $ go build
  $ gofmt -w .

Fetch and install `websocket`:

  $ go get golang.org/x/net/websocket

* Workspaces

The `go` tool derives build instructions from Go source code.

There's no need to write and maintain build scripts.

For this to work, some prescribed directory structure, known as a workspace, is required.

  workspace/
    bin # executable binaries
    pkg # compiled object files
    src # source code


* Create a workspace

Create your workspace now.

  $ mkdir -p $HOME/workshops/c3/gopath/src

(The `bin` and `pkg` sub-directories will be created by the `go` tool.)

Tell the `go` tool where your workspace is by setting the `GOPATH` environment variable:
# You can do this on OS X, Linux, and FreeBSD by adding this line to the `$HOME/.profile` and re-starting any running shells:

  export GOPATH=$HOME/workshops/c3/gopath

# See the installation instructions at golang.org for how to set `GOPATH` under Windows.

You may also want to add the `bin` sub-directory of your workspace to your `PATH`:

  export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin

This lets you run your Go programs without specifying their full path.

(You may want to put these `export` commands in the `.bash_profile` file in your home directory.)

* Choose a namespace

Choose a special place for your Go code.

I use `"github.com/sbinet"`, the root of my GitHub account (useful with `go get`).

For this tutorial, let us all use `"github.com/rse"`

# Once you have chosen a namespace, create the required paths inside the `src` directory of your workspace:

  $ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/rse

Create a `hello` directory in your namespace and copy `hello.go` there:
  
  $ mkdir $GOPATH/src/github.com/rse/hello
  $ cp hello.go $GOPATH/src/github.com/rse/hello/main.go

* Choose a namespace - II

Now you can build and install the `hello` program with the `go` tool:

  $ go install github.com/rse/hello

This builds an executable named `hello`, and installs it to the `bin` directory of your workspace.

  $ $GOPATH/bin/hello
  Hello RSE Conference 2016

* Go - first concepts

* Hello world 2.0

.play _code/hello-web.go

* Hello world 1.0

.play _code/hello-00.go

- `package`
- `func`
- `println` builtin function

* Go types

- primitive types

	int, uint, uint8, ..., uint64, int8, ... int64
	bool, string
	float32, float64
	complex64, complex128

- structs

	struct {
		Name string
		Age  int
	}

- arrays and slices

	[3]string, []float64

- maps

	map[string]int

* Kinds of types (continued)

- pointers

	*int, *Person

- functions

	func(int, int) int
	func(int, float64) (float64, error)

- channels

	chan bool

- interfaces

	interface {
		Start()
		Stop()
	}

* Type declarations

	type [name] [specification]

`Person` is a `struct` type.

	type Person struct {
		name string
		age  int
	}

`Celsius` is a `float64` type.

	type Celsius float64

* Function declarations

	func [name] ([params]) [return value]
	func [name] ([params]) ([return values])

A sum function:

	func sum(a int, b int) int {
		return a + b
	}

A function with multiple return values:

	func divMod(a, b int) (int, int) {
		return a / b, a % b
	}

Made clearer by naming the return values:

	func divMod(a, b int) (quo, rem int) {
		return a / b, a % b
	}


* Declaring variables

Normal declaration:

    var text string = "hello"

You can omit types:

    var text = "hello"

And inside of functions:

    text := "hello"

Other types

    a := 0                             // int
    b := true                          // boolean
    f := 1.0                           // float64
    p := Person{"Sébastien", "Binet"}  // Person

* No implicit numeric conversion

Given types:

    type Celsius float64

    type Fahrenheit float64

And the variables:

    var freezing Fahrenheit = 32
    var boiling Celsius = 100

This code won't compile:

    sauna := (freezing + boiling) / 2

There's no implicit numeric conversion in Go.

* Pointers and memory allocation

* Pointers

Go has pointers:

    var p *int
    p = new(int)

But no pointer arithmetics:

    var p *int = &a[0]
    var q = p+2            // invalid

There's `new` but there's no `delete`.

Memory is garbaged collected after it's no longer accessible.

* Memory allocation

The compiler decides where to allocate based on escape analysis.

Using `new` doesn't imply using the heap:

`stack.go`:

    func get() int {
        n := new(int)
        return *n
    }

And not all values in the heap are created with `new`:

`heap.go`:

    func get() *int {
        n := 4
        return &n
    }


* Packages & Imports

Every [[https://golang.org/][Go]] program is made up of packages.

Programs start running in `package` `main`.

This program is using the packages with import paths `"fmt"` and `"math/rand"`.

By convention, the package name is the same as the last element of the import path.
For instance, the `"math/rand"` package comprises files that begin with the statement `package` `rand`.

.play _code/packages.go


* Exported names

In [[https://golang.org/][Go]], a name is *exported* if it begins with a *capital* *letter*.
For example, `Pizza` is an exported name, as is `Pi`, which is exported from the `math` package.

`pizza` and `pi` do not start with a capital letter, so they are not exported.

When importing a package, you can refer only to its exported names.
Any "unexported" names are not accessible from outside the package.

Run the code. Notice the error message.

.play _code/exported-names.go

* ex-01: a program printing out its arguments

Create `$GOPATH/src/github.com/rse/ex-01/main.go` with the following content:

.code _code/ex-01.go

  ## build and install ex-01
  $ go get github.com/rse/ex-01
  
  ## run ex-01:
  $ ex-01 foo bar baz 01234
  args: [ex-01 foo bar baz 01234]

  $ `which ex-01` foo bar baz 01234 
  args: [/home/binet/atelier-go/work/bin/ex-01 foo bar baz 01234]

* Interlude: godoc

Browsing documentation is performed with `godoc`.

  $ godoc os | less

  PACKAGE DOCUMENTATION

  package os
    import "os"

    Package os provides a platform-independent interface to operating system
    functionality. The design is Unix-like, although the error handling is
    Go-like; failing calls return values of type error rather than error
    numbers. Often, more information is available within the error. For
    example, if a call that takes a file name fails, such as Open or Stat,
    the error will include the failing file name when printed and will be of
    type *PathError, which may be unpacked for more information.


* 

  $ godoc os File | less


  type File struct {
      // contains filtered or unexported fields
  }
      File represents an open file descriptor.
  
  func Create(name string) (file *File, err error)
      Create creates the named file mode 0666 (before umask), truncating it if
      it already exists. If successful, methods on the returned File can be
      used for I/O; the associated file descriptor has mode O_RDWR. If there
      is an error, it will be of type *PathError.
  
  func Open(name string) (file *File, err error)
      Open opens the named file for reading. If successful, methods on the
      returned file can be used for reading; the associated file descriptor
      has mode O_RDONLY. If there is an error, it will be of type *PathError.

* ex-01 - II

  $ godoc os Args

  var Args []string
      Args hold the command-line arguments, starting with the program name.


Modify `ex-01` to iterate over this slice and print each argument (except the executable name) on a line, prefixed with its index number:

  $ ex-01 foo baz
  0: "foo"
  1: "baz"

(Make sure it still works when no argument is passed to the command)

*Hint:* look for the `"range"` and `"for"` keywords on [[https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#for][Effective Go]].

.code _code/ex-01-index.go

* ex-02 - a simple calculator

Let's create a new `ex-02` program taking integers as arguments from the command line and returning their sum:

  ## build+install ex-02
  $ go get github.com/rse/ex-02
  
  $ ex-02 1 2 3 4 100
  sum= 110

  $ ex-02 1 2 3 4 100 01
  sum= 111

  $ ex-02 1 2 3 4 100 1.2
  **error** strconv.ParseInt: parsing "1.2": invalid syntax

*Hint:* `godoc` `strconv`

* ex-02 - a simple calculator

Solution on the next slide...

* ex-02 - solution

.code _code/ex-02.go


* ex-02 - II

Let's modify `ex-02` to take an optional `-v` argument to enable a verbose mode, displaying the running sum:

  $ ex-02 -v 1 2 3 4 100
  0
  + 1 -> 1
  + 2 -> 3
  + 3 -> 6
  + 4 -> 10
  + 100 -> 110
  ===============
  sum= 110


  $ ex-02 1 2 3 4 100
  sum= 110

*Hint:* `godoc` `flag`
*Hint:* beware, correctly handle the extra `-v` argument.


* ex-02 - II (solution)

.code _code/ex-02-flag.go /^func main/,/^}/ HLflag


* ex-03 - loops & functions

As a simple way to play with functions and loops, implement the square root function using Newton's method.

In this case, Newton's method is to approximate Sqrt(x) by picking a starting point z and then repeating:

.image _figs/newton.png

To begin with, just repeat that calculation 10 times and see how close you get to the answer for various values (1, 2, 3, ...).

Next, change the loop condition to stop once the value has stopped changing (or only changes by a very small delta).
See if that's more or fewer iterations.
How close are you to the `math.Sqrt`?

* ex-03 - loops & functions

.play _code/ex-03-start.go

* ex-03 - loops & functions

Solution on the next slide...

* ex-03 - loops & functions

.play _code/ex-03-s1.go

* ex-03 - loops & functions

.play _code/ex-03-s2.go

* ex-04 - rot13

Let's create a new `rot13` package:

  $ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/rse/rot13

- `rot13` will implement the Caesar cipher ("rotate by 13 places"):

.link http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13


* ex-04 - rot13 - II

- in that `rot13` package, create `rot13_test.go` with the following content:

.code _code/rot13_test.go /STARTIMPORT OMIT/,/ENDIMPORT OMIT/ HLxxx


* ex-04 - rot13 - III

- in that `rot13` package, create `rot13_test.go` with the following content:

.code _code/rot13_test.go /^func TestRot13/,/^}/ HLxxx


* ex-04 - rot13 - IV

- still in `rot13`, create `rot13.go` with the following content:

  package rot13

  func rot13(b byte) byte {
       // ...
  }

- under this `rot13` transformation, `"hello"` should become `"uryyb"`

- run:

  $ go test -v
  === RUN TestRot13
  --- PASS: TestRot13 (0.00 seconds)
  PASS
  ok  	github.com/rse/rot13	0.002s
  
and modify the `rot13` function until the test passes.

- `go` `test` builds and runs the tests in the local directory.

* Interlude: Interfaces

* Interfaces

An interface type is defined as a set of method signatures.

A value of interface type can hold any value that implements those methods.

  type Abser interface {
      Abs() float64
  }
  
  type Reader interface {
      Read(data []byte) (int, error)
  }


_E.g.:_ the type `MyFloat` implements the `Abser` interface:

  type MyFloat float64
  
  func (f MyFloat) Abs() float64 {
  	if f < 0 {
  		return float64(-f)
  	}
  	return float64(f)
  }

* Interfaces

Modify the code below to make `MyFloat` and `Vertex` implement the `Abser` interface:

.play _code/ex-interfaces.go /STARTABSER OMIT/,/ENDABSER OMIT/

* Interfaces

A common pattern in `Go` is an `io.Reader` that wraps another `io.Reader`, modifying the stream in some way.

A typical example is the `compress/gzip.NewReader` function which takes an `io.Reader` (a stream of gzipped data) and returns a `*gzip.Reader` that also implements `io.Reader` (a stream of the decompressed data).

.code _code/gz-r.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

 $ cat $GOPATH/src/github.com/sbinet/rse-conf-go-2016/testdata/data.gz | my-gunzip

* ex-04 - V

- create a new `ex-04` program with the following content:

.code _code/ex-04.go HLxxx


* ex-04 - VI

- now, in `rot13.go` implement the `io.Reader` interface:

.code _code/rot13.go /STARTROT13 OMIT/,/ENDROT13 OMIT/

  func (r reader) Read(p []byte) (int, error) {
       // ...
  }

- eventually, the following should work:

  $ echo "hello" | ex-04
  uryyb

  $ echo "hello" | ex-04 | ex-04
  hello


* A (final) larger example


* Top 10 identifiers in std library

.code _code/idents.go

  $ cat $(find $(go env GOROOT) -name '*.go') | ./idents | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | sed 10q
  4.76s user 3.66s system 134% cpu 6.27s total

* A variation: Histogram of Go statements

A histogram is a map from statement name ("if", "for", etc.) to use count:

.code _code/histo0.go /histogram START/,/histogram END/

Algorithm:

- Use walkStdLib to traverse all files of the std library
- For each file, parse and create abstract syntax tree
- Traverse syntax tree and add each statement to histogram
- Print the result

.code _code/histo0.go /main START/,/main END/

* A variation: Histogram of Go statements

Let's create a new program called `indexer`.

Initial code in: [[http://github.com/sbinet/rse-conf-go-2016/blob/master/cmd/indexer/main.go][github.com/sbinet/rse-conf-go-2016/cmd/indexer]]

* Processing a Go source file

.code _code/histo0.go /add START/,/add END/


* Printing the histogram

.play _code/histo0.go /print START/,/print END/

Note: Histogram (map) iteration order is not specified.

  4.76s user 3.66s system 134% cpu 6.27s total

* Sorting

sort.Sort operates on any type that implements the sort.Interface:

	interface {
		Len() int
		Swap(i, j int)
		Less(i, j int) bool
	}

For instance, to sort a slice of strings lexically, define:

.code _code/sort.go /lexical START/,/lexical END/

And sort:

	sort.Sort(lexical(s))  // where s is a []string slice


* Sorting histogram entries

.code _code/histo.go /byCount START/,/byCount END/


* Improved histogram printing

.play _code/histo.go /print START/,/print END/

 
* Concurrency

* Goroutines

- The _go_ statement launches a function call as a goroutine
	go f()
	go f(x, y, ...)

- A goroutine runs concurrently (but not necessarily in parallel)
- A goroutine has its own stack


* A simple example

.code _code/concurrency1.go /f START/,/f END/

Function f is launched as 3 different goroutines, all running concurrently:

.play _code/concurrency1.go /main START/,/main END/


* Communication via channels

A channel type specifies a channel value type (and possibly a communication direction):

	chan int
	chan<- string  // send-only channel
	<-chan T       // receive-only channel

A channel is a variable of channel type:

	var ch chan int
	ch := make(chan int)  // declare and initialize with newly made channel

A channel permits _sending_ and _receiving_ values:

	ch <- 1   // send value 1 on channel ch
	x = <-ch  // receive a value from channel ch (and assign to x)

Channel operations synchronize the communicating goroutines.

* Communicating goroutines

Each goroutine sends its results via channel ch:

.code _code/concurrency2.go /f START/,/f END/

The main goroutine receives (and prints) all results from the same channel:

.play _code/concurrency2.go /main START/,/main END/


* Putting it all together


* Analyze files concurrently, map-reduce style

Mapper:

.code _code/histop.go /mapper START/,/mapper END/

Reducer:

.code _code/histop.go /reducer START/,/reducer END/

.code _code/histop.go /merge START/,/merge END/


* From sequential program...

.play _code/histo.go /main START/,/main END/


* ... to concurrent program

.play _code/histop.go /main START/,/main END/


* Interlude: Calling C

* cgo

[[https://golang.org/][Go]] has a convenient way to call `C`:

.play _code/cgo.go


* cgo - II

It is also possible to combine `Go` and `C` sources together inside a single package:

  $> mkdir $GOPATH/src/github.com/rse/my-cgo

Inside this new package, put 3 files: `main.go`, `my-cgo-lib.h`, `my-cgo-lib.c`.

`main.go:`
.code _code/my-cgo-main.go

* cgo - III

`my-cgo-lib.h:`
.code _code/my-cgo-lib.h

`my-cgo-lib.c:`
.code _code/my-cgo-lib.c

* cgo - IV

And build/install like so:

  $> go get -v github.com/rse/my-cgo
  github.com/rse/my-cgo
  
  $> my-cgo
  Hello From C
